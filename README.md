# GitHub WordPress Plugin Updater Starter
A starter for writing a plugin that's updated using GitHub instead of the WordPress repository.

## Install & Usage
All you need to do is download the zip and install it like any other plugin. Once it is installed make sure that you change the settings in the update-control.php file to point toward your own account.

Finally start writing your plugin and testing it out.
