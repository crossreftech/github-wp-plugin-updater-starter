# GitHub WordPress Plugin Updater Starter
A starter for writing a plugin that's updated using GitHub instead of the WordPress repository.

## Install & Usage
All you need to do is download the zip and install it like any other plugin. Once it's installed be sure you change the settings in under inc/update-control.php file to point toward your own account.

Finally start writing your plugin.
